            As you can see, my experiences and interests span a large variety of verticals and applications. 
            I've been lucky enough to have experienced a broad array of problems which have lead to a strong foundational knowledge of my craft.
            The rapid prototyping that I've done in my professional career demonstrates my ability to shift focus and build solutions fast. 
            The main benefit that I've experienced from such a diverse background is the ability to leverage my experiences to view problems differently.
            This not only allows me to produce more complete and holistic solutions, but it also reduces the amount of regressions I make when developing solutions.

            Culture is an incredibly important aspect to what I do. 
            I believe it's incredibly important to understand not just the qualifications of who you work with, but the qualities of who you work with.
            I first started coding back when I was in College, studying Geology. I was a rock climbing instructor building an indoor rock wall. 
            As a broke college kid it rock climbing holds were too expensive to purchase which lead me to making my own and building a UV spectrometer to ensure quality of the rock holds.
            with small side projects using micro controllers, I found myself absolutely enveloped with building software.
            Aside from tackling difficult problems at the keyboard I enjoy the outdoors, whether it be rock climbing, skateboarding, snowboarding or just enjoying a sunny day with my wife and dog.
